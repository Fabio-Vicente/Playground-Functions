## About

Here is my first code lines using javascript. üôÉ

This project consists on 13 problem challenges that must be solved using javascript functions.
See each one problem described [below](#challenges).

### Development Skills

- Javascript (ES6);
- Variables;
- Primitive/Reference types;
- Condictional structures (if/else);
- Loop structures (for/for of/for in)
- Functions;
- ESLint;
- Divide and Conquer strategy;
- Programming logical.

<br />

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

  - Node >= 16.13.0

### Instalation

  Use one of these three ways to install project properly.

#### 1. Download ZIP:
>
>  - Click on the `Code` green button at repository top;
>
>      ![Code Button](assets/images/GitHub-code-button.png)
>
>  - Click on `Download ZIP` button;
>
>      ![Code Button](assets/images/GitHub-downloadZIP-button.png)
>  
>  - Unzip the downloaded file in a choosen directory;
>  - Enter on `Playground-Functions-main` extracted folder;

#### 2. Clone repository via HTTPS:
>
>  - Use `https://github.com/Fabio-Vicente/Playground-Functions.git` endpoint for clonning via HTTPS (credencials may be needed);
>  - Enter on `Playground-Functions` cloned folder;


#### 3. Clone repository via SSH:
>
>  - Use `git@github.com:Fabio-Vicente/Playground-Functions.git` endpoint for clonning via SSH (it must be need set a SSH Key);
>  - Enter on `Playground-Functions` cloned folder;

<br />

## Usage

Follow [challenges instructions](#challenges) for running each one of the functions developed by this project.

<br />

## Lint

The project was staticly tested using [ESLint](https://eslint.org/), whose appoints no error on code analyses. This enforces code readbility and standart development style.

### Check ESLint running

#### Requiriments:
  - NPM >= 8.1.0

Since you have project [installed locally](#instalation), you must install dependencies using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/).

```sh
  npm install
```

After that, you can verify [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) rules attendance running command:

```sh
  npm run lint
```

###### Obs: you'll probably have no response here. It occurs whenever is found no errors on the code styling. Try to make some mess üí© on the code format and run this command again. Now you must see some errors pointed in your terminal.

    <h4>Concat Name</h4>
  </Summary>

  Have a big full name? No worries! Let's reduce this. In this challenge, was built a function which take a array of strings and concat only the last and the first one, at this order. Perfect to abbreviate names.

  ```sh
    sh execChallenge.sh concatName [array of strings]
  ```

  >‚ö†Ô∏è By shell limitations, all array must be enclosed by quotes and inner string must be enclosed by a different quote type. For example: if you use double quote to enclose array, you must use single quote to enclose strings.

  Example:

   ```sh
    sh execChallenge.sh concatName "['F√°bio', 'Lima', 'Vicente', 'dos', 'Santos']"
  ```

    <h4>Hydrate</h4>
  </Summary>

  Don't forget of being hydrated! The logic here is quite simple. For each one drink that you get, you must drink a glass of water. The entry must be as follow:

  ```
    "{Quantity 1} {Drink Kind 1}, {Quantity 2} {Drink Kind 2}, {Quantity 3} {Drink Kind 3}..."
  ```

  #### How can I run this function?

  ```sh
    sh execChallenge.sh hydrate [string]
  ```

  > Remember to enclose string with quotes. For this problem, numeral must be interpreted as strings. By this reason, enclose each of them with a different type quote of the outer string. For example: if you use double quote to enclose outer string, you must use single quote to enclose each numeral.

  Examples:

   ```sh
    sh execChallenge.sh hydrate "'1' orange juice"
  ```

  ```sh
    sh execChallenge.sh hydrate "'1' orange juice, '5' lemonades e '1' wine"
  ```
